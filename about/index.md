I work in IT @ [MIT](http://mit.edu) and you can find out more about my professional career on linkedin. 
On a personal level, I'm interested in social network analysis, process improvement & automation,and the 
impact of technology on the individual. I'm also a believer that design is code and "code is law", and 
Python is my code of choice so far.
