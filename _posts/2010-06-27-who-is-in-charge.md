A couple of days ago i wrote about how iPhone 3G users are being told that Apple knows best when it comes to the iOS 4 features that shouldn't  be allowed to run on an iPhone 3G. I also hinted at the idea of curated computing and how we as end users are willingly giving away control of devices we buy for a promise of a better user experience [(previous post)](/iphone-and-the-curated-computing-experience/).  
<br>
This week, the iPhone 4 came out and a [few issues](http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20100624/sc_livescience/iphone4sfirstusersreportreceptioncolorproblems) surfaced once the users got their hands on that new phone. I'm not too concerned about the reported problems, but what i'm truly concerned about is Apple's initial response, mainly [Steve Jobs' reply](http://gizmodo.com/5573680/) to an email from a concerned customer. What is even more bothersome is the lack of reaction by customers to such a response from Apple.

"Just avoid holding it (phone) in that way"

I'm a Mac user, i'm writing this on a MacBook Pro, i have an iPhone 3G, i recently bought my mom an iPad ... but those recent events have made me question the idea of how much control is too much? How much are we willing to give up for this less complex, more relevant experience?  
<br>
Here are a few examples related to Apple knows best approach:

* Apps have to be approved by Apple 
* Flash isn't allowed to work (officially it's stated that this is due to technical reasons, but i think there's more to that - think [iAd](http://advertising.apple.com/))
* Some iOS 4 features are not enabled for iPhone 3G 
* Instructions on how not to hold the phone

You have to give a lot of credit to Apple for making smart phones and tablet PCs devices that everyone's craving for. In addition, some of the reasoning behind the first two or three points above given by Apple make some sense. Users don't want to end up with smart phones that act like an error prone Windows box, but do we have to go to such an extreme to achieve this hassle-free experience and where do we draw the line?  
<br>
I think this should make you pause and think how much control is too much? I really enjoy having an iPhone, but i don't like being told what i can or can't do with a device that i own, yet it's starting to feel like this is only the beginning and i'm not just talking about smart phones.
