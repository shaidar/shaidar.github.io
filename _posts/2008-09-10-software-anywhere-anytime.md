I work at a University managing labs and a lot of random projects to make the student experience the best it can be. A couple of years back we started a project labeled "Software Anywhere Anytime" in which the end result would be providing some software to students anywhere they might be (on or off-campus) and at anytime. Before getting to this point though, we also needed to improve how we image and distribute software to all our lab machines. After evaluating the options, we decided to go with a product called Softgrid from a small company in Boston called Softricity. Eventually this company was bought out by Microsoft and the new Softgrid name is App-V.   
In addition to Softgrid we use some other software to manage our labs like Deepfreeze by Faronics and software for printing ....

What's this blog gonna be about?

A lot of times my co-workers and i find ourselves thinking: "What are other colleges doing to handle this? How is this university dealing with that?" I'd like to have this type of discussion here. When we went to Softgrid training, we met with some college folks that had already implemented Softgrid and it was great talking to them cause we realized how similar the environments are. They dealt with a lot of the same software, ran into the same problems .... After hearing their point of view on Softgrid, we felt a lot more confident going forward with our implementation.

That's the point of this blog. This is my very first blog by the way. I will be posting things that i think would be good to share and some random ramblings or ideas that we're thinking about. Feel free to leave me any comments.
