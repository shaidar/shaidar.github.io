I woke up the other day thinking about [Augmented Reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) and one idea led to another until i had a complete vision. It was one of those moments that u feel like things have finally clicked. It all made sense at that point. If u haven't heard anything about Augmented Reality or seen any smartphone apps, then click on the link above to catch up. With an existing smartphone app, i can point my phone in the direction i'm heading and it can overlay information about my surroundings. Heard there's work being done on a similiar app to be used by police that when pointed at a license plate, DMV records are overlayed. I've also seen some proof of concepts using [AR in mechanical repairs](http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/23/view/7473/bmw-augmented-reality-to-help-with-car-repairs.html). Remember the first Terminator when Arnold would look at someone and he'd have all that data on that person as an additional layer? It's happening now, but you need a smartphone with the app right now. So, take this one step further and add some glasses or contact lenses that gives u that ability without the use of a smartphone. We don't seem to mind wearing 3D glasses for the "enhanced" viewing experience, right?

So, if cars, humans, phones starts getting embedded with this "new" way of seeing things, advertising would be forced to move in that direction. So, if i have a restaurant, i might stop focusing on the physical sign that i have posted outside the store and move things to the digital world. Naturally this will be advertised as cost cutting, going green and being more efficient. Take this idea one step further. Instead of painting the walls and physically decorating, i'd decorate virtually. I'd even give my loyal customers, as a reward, write access to my interior design and allow them to decorate things the way they'd like. Just like I choose my wallpaper on my desktop and where and how i place shortcuts, i'd grant my customers that ability. If i like someone's design, i'd make it universally readable! Imagine this then. You and I are both sitting at the same table in this restaurant, yet we're both experiencing it in a completely different way through our own augmented realities. So close, yet so far away!  
<br>
Would that result in breaking the physical boundaries on some things? If i like some painting that i saw on my last trip to NYC, what's to stop me from buying the digital design on amazon and have it hanging virtually on my living room wall? What impact will this have on copyright?  
<br>
The question that we'll be asking ourselves is, what's real?
