Spent the week in Denver for [Educause 2009](http://www.educause.edu/E2009). First time i've been to either Denver or to the main Educause conference. Everything is getting a Virtual or Cloud computing label. It's kinda sad to see higher education jump on the "Cloud Computing" bandwagon. You'd think as Higher Ed Institutions, they'd correct things rather become part of the [hype cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle). That being said, here are a couple of observations:

* A lot of schools are looking at VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure), but what they fail to understand is that VDI doesn't solve the application layer where most of their problems reside. VDI doesn't enable them to centralize software distribution. A VDI solution might make it easier to develop an application virtualization solution, but it's still a separate layer that needs to be dealt with down the line. So, to me it feels like a lot of the Higher Education institutions are riding the wave of "Inflated Expectations" when it comes to VDI and its role.

* Federation! This is a time when universities are looking outward and trying to find means to collaborate with other institutions. The problem they're dealing with is identity management. If i attend a certain university (A) who has an agreement with university (B) to share library resources for example, how can university (B) know that i belong to university (A)? The framework [(InCommon)](http://www.incommonfederation.org/) and the technology are already in place and more schools are joining the federation. I think this will open up the possibilities of "richer" institutions hosting or even providing services to smaller institutions thus turning some institutions to service providers. In addition, this would force vendors that already provide hosted or "cloud" services to be part of InCommon to gain Higher Ed business. I attended a [session](http://www.educause.edu/E09+Hybrid/EDUCAUSE2009FacetoFaceConferen/Seminar13AIdentityManagementfo/176005) that discussed InCommon and federation, but some of the repercussions of the future of a federated system(s) wasn't mentioned. What do i mean? I think federation would establish multiple federated systems made of numerous colleges and universities. Each "federation" would have its own rules and standards for joining and each institution interested and membership would need to add/improve the federation since there's no point in duplicating efforts. This would mean that the smaller or the less fortunate general degree providing colleges would wither away cause they would not be able to compete with the federated systems. Hence, if u're in the teaching business, you need to work on distinguishing yourself otherwise you will not survive.
