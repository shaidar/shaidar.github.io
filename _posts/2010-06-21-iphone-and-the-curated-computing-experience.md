I'm sure you've heard by now about the new iOS 4 for the iPhone that was just released today. I'm an owner of an iPhone 3G and had already heard that some features of the new OS will not be available for the 3G phones, but i didn't give it much thought at the time. Today it suddenly hit me. I've had this phone for less than two years (June 29th release date) and here i am "pushed" into buying a new phone to get the latest and greatest. What's wrong with that picture? Is that the new "standard" for how long you should keep a smartphone for? I'm in the IT profession and understand hardware limitations, but in most cases an OS vendor posts the minimum requirements for their new OS, but doesn't decide on behalf of their users what's "good" for them. I wouldn't mind having some of the new features turned off by default for the 3G phones, but completely non-existent for a phone that's less than two years old because Apple says so!

This really sounds like the perfect example of:
"[Curated Computing](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/05/curated-computing-whats-next-for-devices-in-a-post-ipad-world.ars): a mode of computing where choice is constrained to deliver less complex, more relevant experiences".

I don't expect anyone to boycott Apple or the iPhone, but i think that people need to pause and think about this for a minute. I love the hassle-free, easy to use experience that most Apple products provide, but i also value the freedom of choice that we might be slowly giving up for that relevant experience. A good read on this topic is ["The Future of the Internet"](http://www.amazon.com/Future-Internet-How-Stop/dp/0300151241/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1277174559&sr=8-1).
