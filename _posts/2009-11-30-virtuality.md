While at an IT Conf in Fall Creek Falls and at the recent Educause Conf in Denver, there were a lot of sessions on Second Life and i was curious enough to attend one just to see what Higher Ed is trying to accomplish through it. A couple of years back, i created an account to check out Second Life out just to see what all the buzz was about. I never wrote down what i thought but at some point i had a tweet that said:  
<br>
"Feels like the virtual is integrating with the real. So why spend time building a virtual world"  
<br>
I woke up today thinking about it for some reason (think it was all that time spent on Modern Warfare 2 and how realistic the maps looked) and while surfing on slashdot and i found the proper wording: [Augmented Reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) . The idea is about adding virtual objects to our reality thus augmenting it. That's been my argument against Second Life and its supporters. We don't gain anything by building a virtual world based on the real world. Why do i need to see some virtual campus when i could get on google and see the real campus? With AR (Augmented Reality) you'd have an extra layer on top of the real. So, i think the next challenge would be who controls that new "virtuality"?
