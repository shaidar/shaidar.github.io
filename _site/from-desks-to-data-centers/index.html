      <p>Stop! Take your eyes off of the screen and look around you! Observe your surroundings! What do you see? A man with a laptop, listening to his iPod and texting away on his smartphone. A group of students each with their own laptop studying, and checking their phones every few minutes for that all important text message. A man staring at his laptop with a bluetooth headset glued to his ear, completely oblivious to his surroundings, discussing a powerpoint presentation. A woman sitting in a comfy chair, legs propped up, playing on her new and shiny iPad while her husband next to her is reading on his kindle. People interacting with technology. Laptops, tablets, smart-phones, music players, game consoles, e-readers ….<br />
<br />
Where does the enterprise desktop model stand in this sea of change?<br />
<br />
I’m not announcing the death of that model as we know it in the foreseeable future since i’m a believer in the existence of an amalgam of interacting technologies. However, I’m constantly baffled with the constant chatter about Virtual Desktop Infrastructure or VDI. Companies that went down the server virtualization path in prior years are hoping to have similar success with VDI, but desktops aren’t servers and what worked in server virtualization may not necessarily apply to desktop virtualization. Current research has shown the impact of desktop virtualization on storage design and i strongly recommend reading the following <a href="http://www.virtuall.nl/download-document/vdi-storage-deep-impact">paper</a> for anyone interested in a VDI implementation. So, what’s the point of spending all this time and effort in migrating a fading model from desks to data centers? With the fast evolution of application stores and marketplaces, the mushrooming of SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) providers, and the increased abilities of web browsers, why are we trying to revive a decaying model and do we honestly believe that moving the desktop to the data center is part of its evolution?<br />
<br />
In trying to answer those questions it finally dawned on me that it’s not about the ‘VD’ in VDI and instead it’s all about the ‘I’. I for Infrastructure. I for personalization. I for the individual. Any proper VDI implementation consciously or unconsciously decouples user data and apps from the OS layer. User data will be housed on an enterprise storage solution and applications will be virtualized when possible or evolved into Web Apps. The decoupling of data and apps from the underlying OS will provide enterprises the control they want and grant them the flexibility of outsourcing some aspects of the enterprise into a public or private cloud. In other words, virtualizing desktops isn’t really an end in itself, but a stepping stone for something major. In a current typical higher education environment, data is scattered between the data center and the desktops, apps are either installed as part of the OS image, pushed out through an ESD solution or in some cases manually installed. VDI will physically detach the end-users from their data and applications and establish the new virtual order.  </p>

<h4 id="virtual-order">Virtual Order</h4>
<p>It’s all around us. Look around you again. See that virtual keyboard that the person next to you is typing on? Notice the guy on the table across reading his ‘virtual’ book. Watch the virtual tweets on your <a href="http://www.layar.com/">layar</a> app. Check out those Ray-Bans on that <a href="http://www.bannerblog.com.au/news/2009/06/35_awesome_augmented_reality_examples.php">virtual mirror</a>. VDI is more than virtual desktops. VDI is part of a movement taking place all around us. VDI is part of the movement that aims at virtualizing the workplace. VDI is forcing vendors to improve their ‘remoting’ protocols so that an engineer touring Germany can modify a CAD model being worked on by his co-worker in the US. Virtual Order!<br />
<br />
Like i said, it’s not about ‘VD’ in VDI and all about the I!</p>
